# Graduate School Recommendation System

This is an initial version of a system to recommend the best colleges for graduate students to apply to, based on program of study, desired degree, immigrant status, GRE scores, etc.

The program scapes data from thegradcafe.com and extracts useful information to help make college recommendations for graduate students.
